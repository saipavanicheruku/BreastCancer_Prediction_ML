# BreastCancer Prediction using ML techniques

• Cancerous cell prediction modelling by applying machine learning techniques on cancer data. 

• Implemented KNN, Logistic Regression and Decision tree to predict probability of a person suffering 
from cancer. Utilized confusion matrix to validate the models.

• Calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision for all three, to analyze the best model 
for cancerous cell prediction.
